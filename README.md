# DummyOverlordGame
Personal Entertainment

I personally enjoy the anime overlord quite a lot and I especially found the premise of the game ("Yggdrasil" as it is called in the show), which formed the basis for the plot, quite intriguing. At the time of creating these files I had had no experience and very limited knowledge of OOP and its principles. The goal of this project is not to make a complete game (in fact it is impossible), but rather to reinforce my learning of OOP principles as well as to practice general design and problem solving skills.
